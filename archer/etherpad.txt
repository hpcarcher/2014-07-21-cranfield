Welcome!

We will use this Etherpad to share links and snippets of code, take notes, ask and answer questions, and whatever else comes to mind.

The page displays a screen with three major parts:

* The left side holds today's notes: please edit these as we go along.
* The top right side shows the names of users who are logged in: please add your name and pick the color that best reflects your mood and personality.
* The bottom right is a real time chat window for asking questions of the instructor and your fellow learners.
